cd character-similarity

2️⃣ Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

3️⃣ Run the Notebook
jupyter notebook notebooks/character_similarity.ipynb

📊 Results

Word2Vec embeddings were trained on character dialogues.
Cosine similarity was used to find most similar characters.
The top character similarity pairs are visualized as a heatmap.
